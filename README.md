# Skills
1. Analysis and Critical Thinking
   -> In my experience, the basic that QA must have are able to deep analysis and thinking out of the box, why? because the first step in a software development project are grooming/brainstroming. When grooming are started, all the participant share their perspective when team product explain goals of the project in each story with the details (user acceptance case), looking for whats missing and undiscussable or end user behaviour if their face/using the system (user experience). Then when sprint has begun, QA Team will analysis UAC that product team design to create scenario and test case. The 2nd reason is capable to fast reproduce bug/issues. After many projects that has been done, i've gained analysis and critical thinking skill because has faced different area of system.
